Identify Palindrome:

For a given positive number num, identify the palindrome formed by performing the following operations:-

* Add num and its reverse

* Check whether the sum is palindrome or not. If not, add the sum and its reverse and repeat the process
untill a palindrome is obtained.

For example:

If original integer is 195, we get 9339 as the resulting palindrome after the fourth addition:

195 + 591 = 786

786 + 687 = 1473

1473 + 3741 = 5214

5214 + 4125 = 9339

Input format:

Read num from the standard input stream.

Output format:

Print the palindrome calculated to the standard output stream.


Sample Input:

Enter any number: 1123

Sample Output:

Palindrome no. = 4334


Sample Input:

Enter any number: 126

Sample Output:

Palindrome no. = 747
